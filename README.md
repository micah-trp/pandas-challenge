### Note:

Pelase refer to main Jupyter Notebook to run code : note DF tables are named using convention provided. 
  
For the last 3 questions when Binning / grouping was used -   
I have created my own seperate grouped summary table befor using the script suggessted for the final data frame.   
  
Please note the data frames should be the same output although methodology was different.
