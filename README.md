# Pandas - Challenge  
## PySchool - Micah Raquena
#
### Note:

Pelase refer to main Jupyter Notebook to run code : note DF tables are named using convention provided. 
  
For the last 3 questions when Binning / grouping was used -   
I have created my own seperate grouped summary table before using the script suggessted for the final data frame.    
Hence there is method 1 : Straight to aggregation table and metod 2: creating df from varilables generated.
  
Please note the data frames should be the same output although methodology was different.
